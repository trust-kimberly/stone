            <p>In the tradition of marble sculpture, Non-finito is a technique in which some sections of the sculpture are highly articulated while others are left deliberately unarticulated. The term is of Italian origin, and translates literally to “not finished.” Evidence of the technique can be found in Antiquity, during the Renaissance in the work of Michelangelo, during the Modern period in Rodin’s work, as well as today in the work of some contemporary marble sculptors. Forms appear to emerge from the natural texture of marble in the most exemplary of these works.</p>
            <p>In Michelangelo’s Awakening Slave, Non-finito is evident as a consequence, not a deliberate aesthetic device. The figure appears trapped within marble: the torso and muscles of the limbs are smooth and clearly articulated but we see rough stone that has yet to be carved where the hands and feet should be. It is known from his letters and biographies that Michelangelo began this work with the intention of finishing it. Financial trouble, time constraints, loss of inspiration, compositional error, and his death were among the reasons why this and many of his sculptures were never completed. Awakening Slave is a notable precedent because of its accidental yet paradigmatic demonstration of Non-finito.</p>
            <p>Non-finito is an aesthetic choice and symbolic device in Rodin’s Hand of God. The sculpture refers to the Abrahamic creation story as an allegory of the marble sculptor. In the creation story, God creates the first human from a clay-like material. The large hand in the sculpture is the marble sculptor’s hand which symbolizes the Hand of God when it carves material into the form of a human body. The sculpture’s smooth surfaces symbolize human flesh. The masses of rough stone from which the smooth forms emerge symbolize creative potential. The deliberate use of Non-finito in this sculpture allows marble to explicitly function simultaneously as a found object and a symbol. 
                Stone of Sex is a composition of six hands coupled in three gestures, set in stone. One gesture represents touch, another represents embrace, the third represents penetration. The legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015 by The United States Supreme Court triggered the sculpture. As if to set the legality of same sex couples in stone, it was this legal and symbolic defeat of homophobia that guided me towards an acceptance of the common humanity amongst all people, regardless of their sexuality. Furthermore, I’ve come to understand this victory as a part of a larger and ongoing movement against oppression and violence towards the LBGT community. Using Non-finito, I set this understanding in stone. Non-finito has a symbolic function in Stone of Sex; parts of the sculpture appear unfinished just as the work of liberating the LGBT community is “Non-finito,” not finished. 
                The six hands appear to be in the process of excavation; at once emerging out of the marble and buried in it. This notion of excavation recalls the excavation of ancient artifacts such as the Rosetta Stone, a stone that once served as a legal document. Stone can be unpredictably fragile. For this reason, the majority of excavated ancient sculpture exist today as fragments. In figurative stone sculpture, forms such as hands, fingers, and phalluses tend to be the most susceptible to breaking. Thus, the unarticulated nature of the hands in Stone of Sex and serves a protective function; a sacrifice of detail for durability. This sacrifice does not come without reward; the composition can be read simply as an orgy of organic forms. The most articulated sections of Stone of Sex guide the viewer towards the moments that are most critical; where the couples meet, cuddle, and enter each other.</p>
